excerpt: A demonstration of using the "shortening" properties of certain embedding models to greatly reduce latency/cost while retaining near-exact quality
---

This blog post demonstrates the effectiveness of using the [recently released](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) OpenAI `text-embedding-3` embeddings with Vespa.

Specifically, we are interested in the [Matryoshka Representation Learning](https://aniketrege.github.io/blog/2024/mrl/) technique used in training, which lets us "shorten embeddings (i.e. remove some numbers from the end of the sequence) without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties". This allow us to trade off a small amount of accuracy in exchange for much smaller embedding sizes, so we can store more documents and search them faster.

By using [phased ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html), we can re-rank the top K results with the full embeddings in a second step. This produces accuracy on par with using the full embeddings!

We'll use a standard information retrieval benchmark to evaluate result quality with different embedding sizes and retrieval/ranking strategies.

This blog post is also available as a runnable notebook where you can have this app up and running on
[Vespa Cloud](https://cloud.vespa.ai/) in minutes
(<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/vespa-engine/pyvespa/blob/master/docs/sphinx/source/examples/Matryoshka_embeddings_in_Vespa-cloud.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>)

Let's get started! First, install a few dependencies:


```python
!pip3 install -U pyvespa ir_datasets openai pytrec_eval
```

## Examining the OpenAI embeddings


```python
from openai import OpenAI

openai = OpenAI()

def embed(text, model="text-embedding-3-large", dimensions=3072):
   return openai.embeddings.create(input = [text], model=model, dimensions=dimensions).data[0].embedding
```

With these new embedding models, the API supports a `dimensions` parameter. Does this differ from just taking the first N dimensions?


```python
test_input="This is just a test sentence."

full = embed(test_input)
short = embed(test_input, dimensions=8)

print(full[:8])
print(short)
```

    [0.0035371531266719103, 0.014166134409606457, -0.017565304413437843, 0.04296272248029709, 0.012746891938149929, -0.01731124334037304, -0.00855049304664135, 0.044189225882291794]
    [0.05076185241341591, 0.20329885184764862, -0.2520805299282074, 0.6165600419044495, 0.18293125927448273, -0.24843446910381317, -0.1227085217833519, 0.634161651134491]


Numerically, they are not the same. But looking more closely, they differ only by a scaling factor:


```python
scale = short[0]/full[0]
print([x * scale for x in full[:8]])
print(short)
```

    [0.05076185241341591, 0.2032988673141365, -0.2520805173822377, 0.6165600695594861, 0.18293125124128834, -0.2484344748635628, -0.12270853156530777, 0.6341616780980419]
    [0.05076185241341591, 0.20329885184764862, -0.2520805299282074, 0.6165600419044495, 0.18293125927448273, -0.24843446910381317, -0.1227085217833519, 0.634161651134491]


It seems the shortened vector has been L2 normalized to have a magnitude of 1. By cosine similarity, they are equivalent:


```python
from numpy.linalg import norm
from numpy import dot

def cos_sim(e1, e2):
   return dot(e1, e2)/(norm(e1)*norm(e2))

print(norm(short))

cos_sim(short, full[:8])
```

    0.9999999899058183





    0.9999999999999996



This is great, because it means that in a single API call we can get the full embeddings, and easily produce shortened embeddings just by slicing the list of numbers.

Note that `text-embedding-3-large` and `text-embedding-3-small` do **not** produce compatible embeddings when sliced to the same size:


```python
cos_sim(embed(test_input, dimensions=1536), 
        embed(test_input, dimensions=1536, model="text-embedding-3-small"))
```




    -0.03217247156447633



## Getting a sample dataset
Let's download a dataset so we have some real data to embed:


```python
import ir_datasets
dataset = ir_datasets.load('beir/trec-covid')
print("Dataset has", dataset.docs_count(), "documents. Sample:")
dataset.docs_iter()[120]._asdict()
```

    Dataset has 171332 documents. Sample:





    {'doc_id': 'z2u5frvq',
     'text': 'The authors discuss humoral immune responses to HIV and approaches to designing vaccines that induce viral neutralizing and other potentially protective antibodies.',
     'title': 'Antibody-Based HIV-1 Vaccines: Recent Developments and Future Directions: A summary report from a Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise Working Group',
     'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2100141/',
     'pubmed_id': '18052607'}



### Queries
This dataset also comes with a set of queries, and query/document relevance judgements:


```python
print(next(dataset.queries_iter()))
print(next(dataset.qrels_iter()))
```

    BeirCovidQuery(query_id='1', text='what is the origin of COVID-19', query='coronavirus origin', narrative="seeking range of information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus's origin, including its evolution, animal source, and first transmission into humans")
    TrecQrel(query_id='1', doc_id='005b2j4b', relevance=2, iteration='0')


We'll use these later to evaluate the result quality.

## Definining the Vespa application

First, we define a [Vespa schema](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/schemas.html) with the fields we want to store and their type.


```python
from vespa.package import Schema, Document, Field, FieldSet
my_schema = Schema(
            name="my_schema",
            mode="index",
            document=Document(
                fields=[
                    Field(name="doc_id", type="string", indexing=["summary"]),
                    Field(name="text", type="string", indexing=["summary", "index"], index="enable-bm25"),
                    Field(name="title", type="string", indexing=["summary", "index"], index="enable-bm25"),
                    Field(name="url", type="string", indexing=["summary", "index"]),
                    Field(name="pubmed_id", type="string", indexing=["summary", "index"]),
                    
                    Field(name="shortened", type="tensor<float>(x[256])",
                        indexing=["attribute", "index"],
                        attribute=["distance-metric: angular"]
                    ),
                    Field(name="embedding", type="tensor<float>(x[3072])",
                        indexing=["attribute"],
                        attribute=["paged", "distance-metric: angular"],
                    ),
                ],
            ),
            fieldsets=[
                FieldSet(name = "default", fields = ["title", "text"])
            ]
)
```

The two fields of type `tensor<float>(x[3072/256])` are not in the dataset - they are tensor fields to hold the embeddings from OpenAI.

* `shortened`: This field holds the embedding shortened to 256 dimensions, requiring only **8.3%** of the memory.  `index` here means we will build an [HNSW Approximate Nearest Neighbor index](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html), by which we can find the closest vectors while exploring only a very small subset of the documents.

* `embedding`: This field contains the full size embedding. It is [paged](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/attributes.html#paged-attributes): accesses to this field may require disk access, unless it has been cached by the kernel.

We must add the schema to a Vespa [application package](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/application-packages.html).
This consists of configuration files, schemas, models, and possibly even custom code (plugins).


```python
from vespa.package import ApplicationPackage

vespa_app_name = "matryoshka"
vespa_application_package = ApplicationPackage(
        name=vespa_app_name,
        schema=[my_schema]
)
```

In the last step, we configure [ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/ranking.html) by adding `rank-profile`'s to the schema.

Vespa supports has a rich set of built-in [rank-features](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/rank-features.html), including many
text-matching features such as:

- [BM25](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/bm25.html),
- [nativeRank](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/nativerank.html)
and [many more](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/rank-features.html).

Users can also define custom functions using [ranking expressions](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/ranking-expressions.html).

The following defines three runtime selectable Vespa ranking profiles:
* `exact` uses the full-size embedding
* `shortened` uses only 256 dimensions (exact, or using the approximate nearest neighbor HNSW index)
* `rerank` uses the 256-dimension shortened embeddings (exact or ANN) in a first phase, and the full 3072-dimension embeddings in a second phase. By default the second phase is applied to the top 100 documents from the first phase.


```python
from vespa.package import RankProfile, Function, FirstPhaseRanking, SecondPhaseRanking

exact = RankProfile(
    name="exact",
    inputs=[
        ("query(q3072)", "tensor<float>(x[3072])")
        ],
    functions=[
        Function(
            name="cos_sim",
            expression="closeness(field, embedding)"
        )
    ],
    first_phase=FirstPhaseRanking(
        expression="cos_sim"
    ),
    match_features=["cos_sim"]
)
my_schema.add_rank_profile(exact)


shortened = RankProfile(
    name="shortened",
    inputs=[
        ("query(q256)", "tensor<float>(x[256])")
        ],
    functions=[
        Function(
            name="cos_sim_256",
            expression="closeness(field, shortened)"
        )
    ],
    first_phase=FirstPhaseRanking(
        expression="cos_sim_256"
    ),
    match_features=["cos_sim_256"]
)
my_schema.add_rank_profile(shortened)


rerank = RankProfile(
    name="rerank",
    inputs=[
        ("query(q3072)", "tensor<float>(x[3072])"),
        ("query(q256)", "tensor<float>(x[256])")
        ],
    functions=[
        Function(
            name="cos_sim_256",
            expression="closeness(field, shortened)"
        ),
        Function(
            name="cos_sim_3072",
            expression="cosine_similarity(query(q3072), attribute(embedding), x)"
        ),
    ],
    first_phase=FirstPhaseRanking(
        expression="cos_sim_256"
    ),
    second_phase=SecondPhaseRanking(
        expression="cos_sim_3072"
    ),
    match_features=["cos_sim_256", "cos_sim_3072"]
)
my_schema.add_rank_profile(rerank)
```

For an example of a `hybrid` rank-profile which combines semantic search with traditional text retrieval such as BM25, see the previous blog post: [Turbocharge RAG with LangChain and Vespa Streaming Mode for Sharded Data](https://blog.vespa.ai/turbocharge-rag-with-langchain-and-vespa-streaming-mode/)

## Deploy the application to Vespa Cloud

With the configured application, we can deploy it to [Vespa Cloud](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/).
It is also possible to deploy the app using docker; see the [Hybrid Search - Quickstart](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started-pyvespa.html) guide for
an example of deploying it to a local docker container.

Install the Vespa CLI using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - or download a binary from GitHub as demonstrated below.


```python
!brew install vespa-cli
```

    [33mWarning:[0m vespa-cli 8.294.50 is already installed and up-to-date.
    To reinstall 8.294.50, run:
      brew reinstall vespa-cli


Alternatively, if running in Colab, download the Vespa CLI:


```python
import os
import requests
res = requests.get(url="https://api.github.com/repos/vespa-engine/vespa/releases/latest").json()
os.environ["VERSION"] = res["tag_name"].replace("v", "")
!curl -fsSL https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/releases/download/v${VERSION}/vespa-cli_${VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -zxf -
!ln -sf /content/vespa-cli_${VERSION}_linux_amd64/bin/vespa /bin/vespa
```

To deploy the application to Vespa Cloud we need to create a tenant in the Vespa Cloud:

Create a tenant at [console.vespa-cloud.com](https://console.vespa-cloud.com/) (unless you already have one).
This step requires a Google or GitHub account, and will start your [free trial](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/free-trial).
Make note of the tenant name, it is used in the next steps.

### Configure Vespa Cloud date-plane security

Create Vespa Cloud data-plane mTLS cert/key-pair. The mutual certificate pair is used to talk to your Vespa cloud endpoints. See [Vespa Cloud Security Guide](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/security/guide) for details.

We save the paths to the credentials for later data-plane access without using pyvespa APIs.


```python
import os

os.environ["TENANT_NAME"] = "vespa-team" # Replace with your tenant name

vespa_cli_command = f'vespa config set application {os.environ["TENANT_NAME"]}.{vespa_app_name}'

!vespa config set target cloud
!{vespa_cli_command}
!vespa auth cert -N
```

Validate that we have the expected data-plane credential files:


```python
from os.path import exists
from pathlib import Path

cert_path = Path.home() / ".vespa" / f"{os.environ['TENANT_NAME']}.{vespa_app_name}.default/data-plane-public-cert.pem"
key_path = Path.home() / ".vespa" / f"{os.environ['TENANT_NAME']}.{vespa_app_name}.default/data-plane-private-key.pem"

if not exists(cert_path) or not exists(key_path):
    print("ERROR: set the correct paths to security credentials. Correct paths above and rerun until you do not see this error")
```

Note that the subsequent Vespa Cloud deploy call below will add `data-plane-public-cert.pem` to the application before deploying it to Vespa Cloud, so that
you have access to both the private key and the public certificate. At the same time, Vespa Cloud only knows the public certificate.

### Configure Vespa Cloud control-plane security

Authenticate to generate a tenant level control plane API key for deploying the applications to Vespa Cloud, and save the path to it.

The generated tenant api key must be added in the Vespa Console before attemting to deploy the application.

```
To use this key in Vespa Cloud click 'Add custom key' at
https://console.vespa-cloud.com/tenant/TENANT_NAME/account/keys
and paste the entire public key including the BEGIN and END lines.
```


```python
#!vespa auth api-key

from pathlib import Path
api_key_path = Path.home() / ".vespa" / f"{os.environ['TENANT_NAME']}.api-key.pem"
```

### Deploy to Vespa Cloud

Now that we have data-plane and control-plane credentials ready, we can deploy our application to Vespa Cloud!

`PyVespa` supports deploying apps to the [development zone](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/reference/environments#dev-and-perf).

>Note: Deployments to dev and perf expire after 7 days of inactivity, i.e., 7 days after running deploy. This applies to all plans, not only the Free Trial. Use the Vespa Console to extend the expiry period, or redeploy the application to add 7 more days.


```python
from vespa.deployment import VespaCloud

def read_secret():
    """Read the API key from the environment variable. This is
    only used for CI/CD purposes."""
    t = os.getenv("VESPA_TEAM_API_KEY")
    if t:
        return t.replace(r"\n", "\n")
    else:
        return t

vespa_cloud = VespaCloud(
    tenant=os.environ["TENANT_NAME"],
    application=vespa_app_name,
    key_content=read_secret() if read_secret() else None,
    key_location=api_key_path,
    application_package=vespa_application_package)
```

Now deploy the app to Vespa Cloud dev zone.

The first deployment typically takes 2 minutes until the endpoint is up.


```python
from vespa.application import Vespa
app:Vespa = vespa_cloud.deploy()
```

    Finished deployment.


## Get OpenAI embeddings for documents in the dataset

When producing the embeddings, we concatenate the title and text into a single string. We could also have created two separate embedding fields for text and title, combining the rank scores for these fields in a Vespa [rank expression](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/ranking-expressions-features.html).


```python
import concurrent.futures

def embed_doc(doc):
  embedding = embed((doc.title + " " + doc.text)[:8192]) # we crop the ~25 documents which are longer than the context window
  shortened = embedding[0:256]
  return {
      "doc_id": doc.doc_id,
      "text": doc.text,
      "title": doc.title,
      "url": doc.url,
      "pubmed_id": doc.pubmed_id,
      
      "shortened": {"type":"tensor<float>(x[256])","values":shortened},
      "embedding": {"type":"tensor<float>(x[3072])","values":embedding}
  }

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
        my_docs_to_feed = list(executor.map(embed_doc, dataset.docs_iter()[:100])) # only embed 100 docs while developing
```

## Feeding the dataset and embeddings into Vespa

Now that we have parsed the dataset and created an object with the fields that we want to add to Vespa, we must format the
object into the format that PyVespa accepts. Notice the `fields`, `id` and `groupname` keys. The `groupname` is the
key that is used to shard and co-locate the data and is only relevant when using Vespa with [streaming mode](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/streaming-search.html).


```python
from typing import Iterable
def vespa_feed(user:str) -> Iterable[dict]:
    for doc in reversed(my_docs_to_feed):
        yield {
            "fields": doc,
            "id": doc["doc_id"],
            "groupname": user
        }
```

Now, we can feed to the Vespa instance (`app`), using the `feed_iterable` API, using the generator function above as input
with a custom `callback` function.


```python
from vespa.io import VespaResponse

def callback(response:VespaResponse, id:str):
    if not response.is_successful():
        print(f"Document {id} failed to feed with status code {response.status_code}, url={response.url} response={response.json}")

app.feed_iterable(schema="my_schema", iter=vespa_feed(""), callback=callback, max_queue_size=8000, max_workers=64, max_connections=128)
```

### Embedding the queries
We need to obtain embeddings for the queries from OpenAI. If only using the shortened embedding for the query, you should specify this in the OpenAI API call to reduce latency.


```python
queries = []
for q in dataset.queries_iter():
    queries.append({'text': q.text, 'embedding': embed(q.text), 'id': q.query_id})
```

### Querying data

Now we can query our data. We'll do it in a few different ways, using the rank profiles we defined in the schema:

- Exhaustive (exact) nearest neighbor search with the full embeddings (3072 dimensions)
- Exhaustive (exact) nearest neighbor search with the shortened 256 dimensions
- Approximate nearest neighbor search, using the 256 dimension ANN HNSW index
- Approximate nearest neighbor search, using the 256 dimension ANN HNSW index in the first phase, then reranking top 100 hits with the full embeddings

The query request uses the Vespa Query API  and the `Vespa.query()` function
supports passing any of the Vespa query API parameters.

    Sample query: what is the origin of COVID-19


    {
      "id": "index:matryoshka_content/0/16c7e8749fb82d3b5e37bedb",
      "relevance": 0.6591723960884718,
      "source": "matryoshka_content",
      "fields": {
        "matchfeatures": {
          "cos_sim_256": 0.5481410972571522,
          "cos_sim_3072": 0.6591723960884718
        },
        "doc_id": "beguhous"
      }
    }


Here's the top result from the first query. Notice the `matchfeatures` that returns the match-features from the rank-profile.

Now for each method of querying, we'll run all our queries and note the rank of each document in the response:


```python
global qt

def run_queries(query_function):
    print("\nrun", query_function.__name__, )
    results = {}
    for q in queries:
        response = query_function(q)
        assert(response.is_successful())        
        print(".", end="")
        results[q['id']] = {}
        for pos, hit in enumerate(response.hits, start=1):
            global qt 
            qt += float(response.get_json()['timing']['querytime'])
            results[q['id']][hit['fields']['doc_id']] = pos
    return results

query_functions = ( query_exact, query_256, query_256_ann, query_rerank )
runs = {}

with app.syncio() as session:
    for f in query_functions:
        qt=0
        runs[f.__name__] = run_queries(f)
        print(" avg query time {:.4f} s".format(qt/len(queries)))
```

    
    run query_exact


    .................................................. avg query time 2.7918 s
    
    run query_256
    .................................................. avg query time 0.3040 s
    
    run query_256_ann
    .................................................. avg query time 0.0252 s
    
    run query_rerank
    .................................................. avg query time 0.0310 s


The query time numbers here are NOT a proper benchmark but can illustrate some significant trends for this case:

* Doing exact NN with 3072 dimensions is too slow and expensive for many use cases
* Reducing dimensionality to 256 reduces latency by an order of magnitude
* Using an ANN index improves query time by another order of magnitude
* Re-ranking the top 100 results with the full embedding causes only a slight increase

We could use [more cores per search](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/performance/sizing-search.html#reduce-latency-with-multi-threaded-per-search-execution) or sharding over multiple nodes to improve latency and handle larger content volumes.

## Evaluating the query results

We need to get the query relevance judgements into the format supported by pytrec_eval:


```python
qrels = {}

for q in dataset.queries_iter():
    qrels[q.query_id] = {}

for qrel in dataset.qrels_iter():
    qrels[qrel.query_id][qrel.doc_id] = qrel.relevance
```

With that done, we can check the scores for the first query:


```python
for docid in runs['query_256_ann']['1']:
    score = qrels['1'].get(docid)
    print(docid, score or "-")
```

    beguhous 2
    k9lcpjyo 2
    pl48ev5o 2
    jwxt4ygt 2
    dv9m19yk 1
    ft4rbcxf 1
    h8ahn8fw 2
    6y1gwszn 2
    3xusxrij -
    2tyt8255 1


 A lot of '2', that is, 'highly relevant' results: Looks promising! Now we can use trec_eval to evaluate all the data for each run. The quality measure we use here is `nDCG@10` - [Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain#Normalized_DCG), computed for the first 10 results of each query. The evaluations are per-query so we compute and report the average per run.


```python
import pytrec_eval

def evaluate(run):
    evaluator = pytrec_eval.RelevanceEvaluator(
        qrels, {'ndcg_cut.10'})
    evaluation = evaluator.evaluate(run)
    
    sum = 0
    for ev in evaluation:
        sum+=evaluation[ev]['ndcg_cut_10']
    return sum/len(evaluation)

for run in runs:
  print(run, "\tndcg_cut_10: {:.4f}".format(evaluate(runs[run])))
```

    query_exact 	ndcg_cut_10: 0.7870
    query_256 	ndcg_cut_10: 0.7574
    query_256_ann 	ndcg_cut_10: 0.7552
    query_rerank 	ndcg_cut_10: 0.7886


## Conclusions

What do the numbers mean? They are good, highly relevant results. This is no great surprise, as the OpenAI embedding models are reported to score high on the [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb), of which our [BEIR](https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir)/TREC-COVID dataset is a part.

More interesting to us, querying with the first 256 dimensions still gives quite good results, while requiring only **8.3%** of the memory. We also note that although the HNSW index is an approximation, result quality is impacted very little, while producing the results an order of magnitude faster.

When adding a second phase to re-rank the top 100 hits using the full embeddings, the results are as good as the exact search, while retaining the lower latency, giving us the best of both worlds.
