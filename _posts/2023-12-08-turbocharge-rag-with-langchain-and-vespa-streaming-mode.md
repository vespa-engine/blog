### TLDR; Vespa streaming mode for partitioned data

Vespa's streaming search solution enables you to integrate a user ID (or any sharding key) into the Vespa document ID. 
This setup allows Vespa to efficiently group each user's data on a small set of nodes and the same disk chunk.
Streaming mode enables low latency searches on a user's data without keeping data in memory.

The key benefits of Vespa streaming mode:

- Eliminating compromises in precision introduced by approximate algorithms
- Achieve significantly higher write throughput, thanks to the absence of index builds required for supporting approximate search.
- Optimize efficiency by storing documents, including tensors and data, on disk, benefiting from the cost-effective economics of storage tiers.
- Storage cost is the primary cost driver of Vespa streaming mode; no data is in memory. Avoiding memory usage lowers deployment costs significantly. 

### Connecting LangChain Retriever with Vespa for Context Retrieval from PDF Documents

In this blog post, we seamlessly integrate a custom [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) 
[retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/) with a Vespa app, 
leveraging Vespa's streaming mode to extract meaningful context from PDF documents.

The workflow: 

- Define and deploy a Vespa [application package](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/application-packages.html) using PyVespa. 
- Utilize [LangChain PDF Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/pdf) to download and parse PDF files.
- Leverage [LangChain Document Transformers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/)
to convert each PDF page into multiple text chunks. 
- Feed the transformer representation to the running Vespa instance
- Employ Vespa's built-in [embedder](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/embedding.html) functionality (using an open-source embedding model) for embedding the text chunks per page, resulting in a multi-vector representation.
- Develop a custom [Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) to enable seamless retrieval for any unstructured text query.

Overview
</div>

Let's get started! First, install dependencies: 

```python
!pip3 install -U pyvespa langchain pypdf openai
```

## Sample data
We love [ColBERT](https://blog.vespa.ai/pretrained-transformer-language-models-for-search-part-3/), so
we will use a few COlBERT-related papers as examples of PDFs:

```python
def sample_pdfs():
    return [
        {
            "title": "ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction",
            "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.01488.pdf",
            "authors": "Keshav Santhanam, Omar Khattab, Jon Saad-Falcon, Christopher Potts, Matei Zaharia"
        },
        {
            "title": "ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT",
            "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf",
            "authors": "Omar Khattab, Matei Zaharia"
        },
        {
            "title": "On Approximate Nearest Neighbour Selection for Multi-Stage Dense Retrieval",
            "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11480.pdf",
            "authors": "Craig Macdonald, Nicola Tonellotto"
        },
        {
            "title": "A Study on Token Pruning for ColBERT",
            "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06540.pdf",
            "authors": "Carlos Lassance, Maroua Maachou, Joohee Park, St√©phane Clinchant"
        },
        {
            "title": "Pseudo-Relevance Feedback for Multiple Representation Dense Retrieval",
            "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11251.pdf",
            "authors": "Xiao Wang, Craig Macdonald, Nicola Tonellotto, Iadh Ounis"
        }

    ]
```

## Definining the Vespa application
[PyVespa](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) helps us build the [Vespa application package](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/application-packages.html). 
A Vespa application package consists of configuration files, schemas, models, and code (plugins).   

First, we define a [Vespa schema](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/schemas.html) with the fields we want to store and their type.

```python
from vespa.package import Schema, Document, Field, FieldSet, HNSW
pdf_schema = Schema(
            name="pdf",
            mode="streaming",
            document=Document(
                fields=[
                    Field(name="id", type="string", indexing=["summary", "index"]),
                    Field(name="title", type="string", indexing=["summary", "index"]),
                    Field(name="url", type="string", indexing=["summary", "index"]),
                    Field(name="authors", type="array<string>", indexing=["summary", "index"]),
                    Field(name="page", type="int", indexing=["summary", "index"]),
                    Field(name="metadata", type="map<string,string>", indexing=["summary", "index"]),
                    Field(name="chunks", type="array<string>", indexing=["summary", "index"]),
                    Field(name="embedding", type="tensor<bfloat16>(chunk{}, x[384])",
                        indexing=["input chunks", "embed e5", "attribute", "index"],
                        ann=HNSW(distance_metric="angular"),
                        is_document_field=False
                    )
                ],
            ),
            fieldsets=[
                FieldSet(name = "default", fields = ["chunks", "title"])
            ]
)
```

The above defines our `pdf` schema using mode `streaming`. Most fields are straightforward, but take notes of:

- `metadata` using `map<string,string>` - here we can store and match over page-level metadata extracted by the PDF parser.
- `chunks` using `array<string>`, these are the text chunks that we use LangChain document transformers for
- The `embedding` field of type `tensor<bfloat16>(chunk{},x[384])` allows us to store and search the 384-dimensional embeddings per chunk in the same Vespa document

The observant reader might have noticed the `e5` argument to the `embed` expression in the above `embedding` field.
The `e5` argument references a component of the type [hugging-face-embedder](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/embedding.html#huggingface-embedder). 
We configure the application package and its name with the `pdf` schema and the `e5` embedder component. 

```python
from vespa.package import ApplicationPackage, Component, Parameter

vespa_app_name = "pdfs"
vespa_application_package = ApplicationPackage(
        name=vespa_app_name,
        schema=[pdf_schema],
        components=[Component(id="e5", type="hugging-face-embedder",
            parameters=[
                Parameter("transformer-model", {"url": "https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/raw/master/simple-semantic-search/model/e5-small-v2-int8.onnx"}),
                Parameter("tokenizer-model", {"url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/master/simple-semantic-search/model/tokenizer.json"})
            ]
        )]
) 
```

In the last step, we configure [ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/ranking.html) by adding `rank-profile`'s to the schema. Vespa supports [phased ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html) and has a rich set of built-in [rank-features](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/rank-features.html), including many text-matching features such as:

- [BM25](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/bm25.html).
- [nativeRank](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/nativerank.html) and many more. 

Users can also define custom functions using [ranking expressions](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/ranking-expressions.html). The following defines a `hybrid` Vespa ranking profile. 

```python
from vespa.package import RankProfile, Function,  FirstPhaseRanking


semantic = RankProfile(
    name="hybrid", 
    inputs=[("query(q)", "tensor<float>(x[384])")],
    functions=[Function(
        name="similarities",
        expression="cosine_similarity(query(q), attribute(embedding),x)"
    )],
    first_phase=FirstPhaseRanking(
        expression="nativeRank(title) + nativeRank(chunks) + reduce(similarities, max, chunk)",
        rank_score_drop_limit=0.0
    ),
    match_features=["closest(embedding)", "similarities", "nativeRank(chunks)", "nativeRank(title)", "elementSimilarity(chunks)"]
)
pdf_schema.add_rank_profile(semantic)
```

The `hybrid` rank-profile above defines the query input embedding type and a similarities function that
uses a Vespa [tensor compute function](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/ranking-expressions.html#tensor-functions) that calculates
the cosine similarity between all the chunk embeddings and the query embedding. The profile only defines a single ranking phase using a linear combination of multiple features. 

Using [match-features](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/schema-reference.html#match-features), Vespa
returns selected features along with the returned hits for a query.

## Deploy the application to Vespa Cloud

With the configured application, we can deploy it to [Vespa Cloud](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/). 
It is also possible to deploy the app using docker; see the [Hybrid Search - Quickstart](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started-pyvespa.html) guide for an example of deploying it to a local docker container. 

### Deploy to Vespa 

`PyVespa` supports deploying apps to the [development zone](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/reference/environments#dev-and-perf),
see the [notebook](https://github.com/vespa-engine/pyvespa/blob/master/docs/sphinx/source/examples/turbocharge-rag-with-langchain-and-vespa-streaming-mode-cloud.ipynb) for details on credentials and onboarding. 

```python
from vespa.deployment import VespaCloud

def read_secret():
    """Read the API key from the environment variable. This is 
    only used for CI/CD purposes."""
    t = os.getenv("VESPA_TEAM_API_KEY")
    if t:
        return t.replace(r"\n", "\n")
    else:
        return t

vespa_cloud = VespaCloud(
    tenant=os.environ["TENANT_NAME"],
    application=vespa_app_name,
    key_content=read_secret() if read_secret() else None,
    key_location=api_key_path,
    application_package=vespa_application_package)
```

Now deploy the app to the Vespa dev zone. 

The first deployment of a new application typically takes 2 minutes until the endpoint is up:

```python
from vespa.application import Vespa
app:Vespa = vespa_cloud.deploy()
```

    Deployment started in run 1 of dev-aws-us-east-1c for samples.pdfs. This may take a few minutes the first time.
    INFO    [10:44:23]  Deploying platform version 8.268.18 and application dev build 1 for dev-aws-us-east-1c of default ...

    Using mTLS (key,cert) Authentication against endpoint https://eb49e7c6.bfbdb4fd.z.vespa-app.cloud//ApplicationStatus
  

### Processing PDFs with LangChain

[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) has a rich set of [document loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/) that can be used to load and process various file formats. This guide uses the [PyPDFLoader](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/pdf#using-pypdf). 

We also want to split the extracted text into *chunks* using a [text splitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/#get-started-with-text-splitters). Most text embedding models have limited input lengths (typically less than 512 language model tokens), so splitting the text into multiple chunks that fit into the context limit of the embedding model is a common technique to overcome
length limitations (and also improve the effectiveness). 

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size = 1024, #chars, not llm tokens
    chunk_overlap  = 0,
    length_function = len,
    is_separator_regex = False,
)
```

The following iterates over the `sample_pdfs` and performs the following:

- Load the URL and extract the text into pages. A page is the retrievable unit we will use in Vespa
- For each page, use the text splitter to split the text into chunks. The chunks are represented as an `array<string>` in the Vespa schema
- Create the page-level Vespa `fields`

```python

import hashlib
import unicodedata
def remove_control_characters(s):
    return "".join(ch for ch in s if unicodedata.category(ch)[0]!="C")

my_docs_to_feed = []
for pdf in sample_pdfs():
    url = pdf['url']
    loader = PyPDFLoader(url)
    pages = loader.load_and_split()
    for index, page in enumerate(pages):
        source = page.metadata['source']
        chunks = text_splitter.transform_documents([page])
        text_chunks = [chunk.page_content for chunk in chunks]
        text_chunks = [remove_control_characters(chunk) for chunk in text_chunks]
        page_number = index + 1
        vespa_id = f"{url}#{page_number}"
        hash_value = hashlib.sha1(vespa_id.encode()).hexdigest()
        fields = {
            "title" : pdf['title'],
            "url" : url,
            "page": page_number,
            "id": hash_value,
            "authors": [a.strip() for a in pdf['authors'].split(",")],
            "chunks": text_chunks, 
            "metadata": page.metadata
        }
        my_docs_to_feed.append(fields)
    
```

Now that we have parsed the input PDFs and created a list of pages that we want to add to Vespa, we must format the
list into the format that PyVespa accepts. Notice the `fields`, `id` and `groupname` keys. The `groupname` is the
key that is used to shard and co-locate the data and is only relevant when using Vespa with streaming mode. 


```python
from typing import Iterable
def vespa_feed(user:str) -> Iterable[dict]:
    for doc in my_docs_to_feed:
        yield {
            "fields": doc,
            "id": doc["id"],
            "groupname": user
        }
```

Now, we can feed to the Vespa instance (`app`) using the `feed_iterable` API, using the generator function above as input
with a custom `callback` function. Vespa also performs embedding inference during this step using the built-in Vespa [embedding](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/embedding.html#huggingface-embedder) functionality. 


```python
from vespa.io import VespaResponse

def callback(response:VespaResponse, id:str):
    if not response.is_successful():
        print(f"Document {id} failed to feed with status code {response.status_code}, url={response.url} response={response.json}")

app.feed_iterable(schema="pdf", iter=vespa_feed("bergum@vespa.ai"), namespace="personal", callback=callback)
```

Notice the `schema` and `namespace` - PyVespa translates these to [Vespa document API](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/document-v1-api-guide.html)
requests, illustrated below. 

![Illustration](/assets/2023-12-08-turbocharge-rag-with-langchain-and-vespa-streaming-mode/docid.png)

### Querying data

Now, we can also query our data. With [streaming mode](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/query-api-reference.html#streaming), 
we must pass the `groupname` parameter, or the request will fail with an error. 

The query request uses the Vespa Query API  and the `Vespa.query()` function 
supports passing any of the Vespa query API parameters. 

Read more about querying Vespa in:

- [Vespa Query API](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-api.html)
- [Vespa Query API reference](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/query-api-reference.html)
- [Vespa Query Language API (YQL)](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-language.html)

Sample query request for `why is colbert effective?` for the user `bergum@vespa.ai`:


```python
from vespa.io import VespaQueryResponse
import json

response:VespaQueryResponse = app.query(
    yql="select id,title,page,chunks from pdf where userQuery() or ({targetHits:10}nearestNeighbor(embedding,q))",
    groupname="bergum@vespa.ai", 
    ranking="hybrid",
    query="why is colbert effective?",
    body={
        "presentation.format.tensors": "short-value",
        "input.query(q)": "embed(e5, \"why is colbert effective?\")",
    }
)
assert(response.is_successful())
print(json.dumps(response.hits[0], indent=2))
```

Aswe show in \u00a74.5, these optimizations can considerably reduce theo\ufb04ine cost of indexing.To begin with, we exploit multiple GPUs, if available, for fasterencoding of batches of documents in parallel. When batching, wepad all documents to the maximum length of a document withinthe batch.3To make capping the sequence length on a per-batchbasis more e\ufb00ective, our indexer proceeds through documents ingroups of B(e.g., B=100,000) documents. It sorts these documentsby length and then feeds batches of b(e.g., b=128) documents ofcomparable length through our encoder. /T_his length-based bucket-ing is sometimes refered to as a BucketIterator in some libraries(e.g., allenNLP).

          "computation) and reduce across query terms via a summation. Fi-nally, we sort the kdocuments by their total scores."

## LangChain Retriever

We use the [LangChain Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) interface so that
we can connect our Vespa app with the flexibility and power of the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) LLM framework. 

>A retriever is an interface that returns documents given an unstructured query. It is more general than a vector store. A retriever does not need to be able to store documents, only to return (or retrieve) them. Vector stores can be used as the backbone of a retriever, but there are other types of retrievers as well.

The retriever interface fits perfectly with Vespa, as Vespa can support a wide range of features and ways to retrieve and
rank content. The following implements a custom retriever `VespaStreamingHybridRetriever`, that takes the following arguments:

- `app:Vespa` The Vespa application we retrieve from. This could be a Vespa Cloud instance or a local instance. 
-  `user:str` The user that that we want to retrieve for, this argument maps to the [Vespa streaming mode groupname parameter](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/query-api-reference.html#streaming.groupname)
- `pages:int` The  target number of PDF pages we want to retrieve for a given query 
- `chunks_per_page` The is the target number of relevant text chunks that are associated with the page
- `chunk_similarity_threshold` - The chunk similarity threshold, only chunks with a similarity above this threshold 

The core idea is to _retrieve_ pages using maximum chunk similarity as the initial scoring function, then consider other chunks on the same page as potentially relevant input to the generative step.

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_core.retrievers import BaseRetriever
from typing import List


class VespaStreamingHybridRetriever(BaseRetriever):

    app: Vespa
    user:str
    pages: int = 5
    chunks_per_page: int = 3 
    chunk_similarity_threshold: float = 0.8
    
    def _get_relevant_documents(self, query: str) -> List[Document]:
        targetHits = self.pages * self.chunks_per_page
        response:VespaQueryResponse = self.app.query(
            yql=f"select id, url, title, page, authors, chunks from pdf where userQuery() or ({targetHits:{targetHits}}nearestNeighbor(embedding,q))",
            groupname=self.user, 
            ranking="hybrid",
            query=query,
            hits = self.pages,
            body={
                "presentation.format.tensors": "short-value",
                "input.query(q)": f"embed(e5, \"query: {query} \")"
            }
        )
        if not response.is_successful():
            raise ValueError(f"Query failed with status code {response.status_code}, url={response.url} response={response.json}")
        return self._parse_response(response)


    def _parse_response(self, response: VespaQueryResponse) -> List[Document]:
        documents: List[Document] = []
        for hit in response.hits:
            fields = hit['fields']
            chunks_with_scores = self._get_chunk_similarities(fields)
            ## Best k chunks from each page 
            best_chunks_on_page = " ### ".join(
                [chunk for chunk, score in 
                    chunks_with_scores[0:self.chunks_per_page] if score > self.chunk_similarity_threshold])
            documents.append(
                Document(
                    id=fields['id'],
                    page_content=best_chunks_on_page,
                    title=fields['title'],
                    metadata={
                        "title": fields['title'],
                        "url": fields['url'],
                        "page": fields['page'],
                        "authors": fields['authors'],
                        "features": fields['matchfeatures']
                    }
                )
            )
        return documents
        
    def _get_chunk_similarities(self, hit_fields: dict) -> List[tuple]:
        match_features = hit_fields['matchfeatures']
        similarities = match_features['similarities']
        chunk_scores = []
        for i in range(0,len(similarities)):
            chunk_scores.append(similarities.get(str(i), 0))
        chunks = hit_fields['chunks']
        chunks_with_scores = list(zip(chunks, chunk_scores))
        return sorted(chunks_with_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

That's it! We can give our newborn retriever a spin for the user¬†`bergum@vespa.ai` by 


```python
vespa_hybrid_retriever = VespaStreamingHybridRetriever(app=app, user="bergum@vespa.ai", pages=1, chunks_per_page=1)
```


```python
vespa_hybrid_retriever.get_relevant_documents("what is the maxsim operator in colbert?")
```

    [Document(page_content='ture that precisely does so. As illustrated, every query embeddinginteracts with all document embeddings via a MaxSim operator,which computes maximum similarity (e.g., cosine similarity), andthe scalar outputs of these operators are summed across queryterms. /T_his paradigm allows ColBERT to exploit deep LM-basedrepresentations while shi/f_ting the cost of encoding documents of-/f_line and amortizing the cost of encoding the query once acrossall ranked documents. Additionally, it enables ColBERT to lever-age vector-similarity search indexes (e.g., [ 1,15]) to retrieve thetop-kresults directly from a large document collection, substan-tially improving recall over models that only re-rank the output ofterm-based retrieval.As Figure 1 illustrates, ColBERT can serve queries in tens orfew hundreds of milliseconds. For instance, when used for re-ranking as in ‚ÄúColBERT (re-rank)‚Äù, it delivers over 170 √óspeedup(and requires 14,000 √ófewer FLOPs) relative to existing BERT-based', metadata={'title': 'ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT', 'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf', 'page': 4, 'authors': ['Omar Khattab', 'Matei Zaharia'], 'features': {'closest(embedding)': {'0': 1.0}, 'elementSimilarity(chunks)': 0.41768707482993195, 'nativeRank(chunks)': 0.1401101487033024, 'nativeRank(title)': 0.0520403737720047, 'similarities': {'1': 0.8369992971420288, '0': 0.8730311393737793}}})]

## RAG 
Finally, we can connect our custom retriever with the complete flexibility and power of the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) LLM framework. The following uses [LangChain Expression Language, or LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/), a declarative way to compose chains.

We have several steps composed into a chain:

- The prompt template and LLM model, in this case using OpenAI
- The retriever that provides the retrieved context for the question 
- The formatting of the retrieved context 

```python
vespa_hybrid_retriever = VespaStreamingHybridRetriever(app=app, user="bergum@vespa.ai", pages=3, chunks_per_page=3)
```


```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.schema import StrOutputParser
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnablePassthrough

prompt_template = """
Answer the question based only on the following context. 
Cite the page number and the url of the document you are citing.

{context}
Question: {question}
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)
model = ChatOpenAI()

def format_prompt_context(docs) -> str:
    context = []
    for d in docs:
        context.append(f"{d.metadata['title']} by {d.metadata['authors']}\n")
        context.append(f"url: {d.metadata['url']}\n")
        context.append(f"page: {d.metadata['page']}\n")
        context.append(f"{d.page_content}\n\n")
    return "".join(context)


chain = (
    {"context": vespa_hybrid_retriever | format_prompt_context, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | model
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

### Interact with the LLM chain 

Now, we can start asking questions using the `chain` defined above. 


```python
chain.invoke("what is colbert?")
```

    'ColBERT is a ranking model that adapts deep language models, specifically BERT, for efficient retrieval. It introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes queries and documents using BERT and then uses a cheap yet powerful interaction step to model their fine-grained similarity. This allows ColBERT to leverage the expressiveness of deep language models while also being able to pre-compute document representations offline, significantly speeding up query processing. ColBERT can be used for re-ranking documents retrieved by a traditional model or for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large document collection. It has been shown to be effective and efficient compared to existing models. (source: ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT by Omar Khattab, Matei Zaharia, page 1, url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf)'




```python
chain.invoke("what is the colbert maxsim operator")
```

    "The ColBERT model utilizes the MaxSim operator, which computes the maximum similarity (e.g., cosine similarity) between query embeddings and document embeddings. The scalar outputs of these operators are summed across query terms, allowing ColBERT to exploit deep LM-based representations while reducing the cost of encoding documents offline and amortizing the cost of encoding the query once across all ranked documents.\n\nSource: \nColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT by ['Omar Khattab', 'Matei Zaharia']\nURL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf\nPage: 4"




```python
chain.invoke("What is the difference between colbert and single vector representational models?")
```

    'The difference between ColBERT and single vector representational models is that ColBERT utilizes a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT, while single vector models use a single embedding vector for both the query and the document. This late interaction mechanism in ColBERT allows for fine-grained similarity estimation, which leads to more effective retrieval. (Source: ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT by Omar Khattab and Matei Zaharia, page 17, url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf)'

## Summary

Vespa's streaming mode is a game-changer, enabling the creation of highly cost-effective RAG applications for naturally partitioned data.

In this tutorial, we delved into the hands-on application of [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction), 
leveraging document loaders and transformers. Finally, we showcased a custom LangChain retriever that connected 
all the functionality of LangChain with Vespa.
