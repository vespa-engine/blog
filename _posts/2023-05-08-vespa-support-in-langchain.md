If you are experimenting using large language models (LLMs) in your applications you are probably
doing that with Langchain. That has become much simpler now with the addition of a Vespa retriever in Langchain.
See the documentation on [the Langchain site](https://python.langchain.com/en/stable/modules/indexes/retrievers/examples/vespa.html).

Also, thanks to Langchain creator Harrison Chase for that [perceptive observation](https://twitter.com/vespaengine/status/1652334794338971655) 
about all you Vespa builders!
