There is a growing interest in AI-powered vector representations of unstructured multimodal data 
and searching efficiently over these representations. This blog post describes how your organization can unlock the full potential of multimodal AI-powered vector representations using Vespa -- the industry-leading open-source big data serving engine. 

## Introduction

Deep Learning has revolutionized information extraction from unstructured data like text, audio, image, and videos. 
Furthermore,  self-supervised learning algorithms like [data2vec](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-first-high-performance-self-supervised-algorithm-that-works-for-speech-vision-and-text/) 
accelerate learning representations of speech, vision, text, and multimodal representations 
combining these modalities. Pre-training deep neural network models using self-supervised
learning without expensive curated labeled data helps scale machine learning as 
adoption and fine-tuning for a specific task requires fewer labeled examples. 

Representing unstructured multimodal data as vectors or tensors unlocks new and exciting use cases 
it wasn't easy to foresee just a few years ago. Even a well-established AI-powered use case like 
search ranking, which has been using AI to improve the search results for decades, 
is going through a [neural paradigm shift](https://blog.vespa.ai/pretrained-transformer-language-models-for-search-part-1/) 
driven by language models like BERT.

These emerging multimodal data-to-vector models increase the insight and knowledge organizations can 
extract from their unstructured data. As a result, organizations leveraging this 
new data paradigm will have a significant competitive advantage over organizations 
not participating in this paradigm shift. 
Learning from structured and unstructured data has historically
primarily been performed offline. 
However, advanced organizations with access to modern infrastructure 
and competence have started transferring the learning process to onstage, 
using [real-time](https://huyenchip.com/2022/01/02/real-time-machine-learning-challenges-and-solutions.html), 
in-session contextual features to improve AI predictions. 

One example of real-time online inference or prediction is within-cart 
[recommendation systems](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/tutorials/news-1-getting-started.html), 
where grocery and [e-commerce](https://blog.vespa.ai/e-commerce-search-and-recommendation-with-vespaai/) sites recommend or predict 
related items to supplement the user's current cart contents. 
An AI-powered recommendation model for this use case could use item-to-item similarity 
or past sparse [user-to-item](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/tutorials/news-1-getting-started.html) interactions. 
Still, without a doubt, using the real-time context, in this case, the cart's contents,  
can improve the model's accuracy. Furthermore, 
creating add-to-cart suggestions for all possible combinations offline is impossible 
due to the combinatoric explosion of likely cart items. 
This use case also has the challenging property that the number of things to choose from is extensive, 
hundreds of millions in the case of Amazon. In addition, [business constraints](https://blog.vespa.ai/constrained-approximate-nearest-neighbor-search/) like in-stock status limit the candidate selection.  

Building technology and infrastructure to perform computationally complex distributed AI inference 
over billions of data items with low user-time serving latency constraints 
is one of the most [challenging problems in computing](https://blog.vespa.ai/the-hardest-problem-in-computing/).  

## Vespa - Serving Engine
Vespa, the open-source big data serving engine, specializes in making it easy for an 
any-sized organization to move AI inference computations online at scale without investing a significant amount of resources in building infrastructure and technology. Vespa is a distributed computation engine that can scale in any dimension. 

- [Scale elastically](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/elasticity.html) with data volume  - handling [billion scale](https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-hybrid-billion-scale-vector-search/) 
datasets efficiently without pre-provisioning resources up-front. 
- Scale update and ingestion rates to handle evolving real-time data.  
- Scale with query volume using state-of-the-art retrieval and index structures and fully use modern hardware stacks.  

In Vespa, AI is a first-class citizen and not an after-thought. The following Vespa primitives are the 
foundational building blocks for building an online AI serving engine:

- **CRUD operations at scale**. Dataset sizes vary across organizations and use cases. Handling fast-paced evolving datasets is one of Vespa's core strengths. Returning to our in-cart recommendation system for a moment, handling in-stock status updates, price changes, or real-time click feedback can dramatically improve the experience - imagine recommending an item out of stock? A lost revenue opportunity and a negative user experience. 
- **Document Model**. Vespa's document model supports structured and unstructured field types, including tensor fields representing single-order dense vectors. Vespa's [tensor storage and compute engine](https://blog.vespa.ai/computing-with-tensors/) 
is built from the ground up. 
The document model with tensor also enables [feature-store](https://blog.vespa.ai/parent-child-joins-tensors-content-recommendation/) functionality, accessing real-time features close to the data.
Features stored as Vespa attributes support in place [real-time updates](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/partial-updates.html) 
at scale (50K updates/s per tensor field per compute node). 
- **A feature-rich query language**. Vespa's [SQL-like query language](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-language.html) 
enables efficient online selection over potentially billions of rows, combining structured and unstructured data in the same query.
- **Machine Learning frameworks and accelerator integrations**. Vespa integrates with the most popular machine learning frameworks like 
[Tensorflow](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/tensorflow), [PyTorch](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/onnx.html), 
[XGboost](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/xgboost.html), and [LightGBM](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/lightgbm.html). 
In addition, Vespa integrates with [ONNX-Runtime](https://blog.vespa.ai/stateful-model-serving-how-we-accelerate-inference-using-onnx-runtime/) 
for [accelerated inference](https://blog.vespa.ai/ml-model-serving-at-scale/) 
with large deep neural network models that accelerate powerful data-to-vector models.
Vespa handles [model versioning](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/tutorials/models-hot-swap.html),
distribution, and auto-scaling of online inference computations.
These framework integrations complement Vespa's native 
support for tensor storage and [calculations over tensors](https://blog.vespa.ai/computing-with-tensors/). 
- **Efficient Vector Search**. AI-powered vector representations are at the core of the unstructured data revolution. Vespa implements a real-time version of the [HNSW](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html) algorithm for efficient Vector search, an implementation that is vetted and verified with multiple vector datasets on [ann-benchmarks.com](https://ann-benchmarks.com/). 
Vespa supports combining vector search [with structured query filters](https://blog.vespa.ai/constrained-approximate-nearest-neighbor-search/) at scale.
