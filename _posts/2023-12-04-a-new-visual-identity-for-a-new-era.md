Two months after announcing [Vespa.ai becoming an independent company](https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-is-becoming-its-own-company/), 
we have reached another small – but important – milestone on our journey into the new era; 
unveiling our new logo and visual identity.

The overall brand identity reflects Vespa's personality as a bold, Scandinavian company. The
geometric and forward-leaning logo is inspired by the no-nonsense and unbeatable performance. The
symbol can be interpreted as a simple box, the initial letter V from "Vespa" or simple brackets. But
it can also be seen as a three-dimensional and scalable container of data, thus answering the
concept of "Moving mountains, not data".

In addition to the new logo, we are updating our typographic palette, ensuring a professional yet
available tone of voice and cross-platform legibility. The defined color scheme picks up on elements
from Scandinavian elements such as heather, rocks, light, and glaciers. Our high contrast brand
icons recognize the 45° angle from the logo, but at the same time the thin hairlines point to
Vespa’s high level of performance and precision. Our photographic style reflects our Scandinavian
origin; Vespa is solid like mountains, agile like water, and complex like a finely tuned ecosystem.

The updated profile will be rolling out in the weeks to come and while this is an important visual
hint of a new era, we are even more excited about the upcoming new and exciting features for both
the Vespa platform and [Vespa Cloud](https://cloud.vespa.ai/) that we will be announcing in the 
months to come.
