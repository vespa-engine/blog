The [first blog post](https://blog.vespa.ai/billion-scale-knn/) on billion-scale 
vector search covered methods for compressing real-valued vectors to binary representations 
and using hamming distance for efficient coarse level search. 
The [second post](https://blog.vespa.ai/billion-scale-knn-part-two/) described approximate nearest neighbor search tradeoffs
using [Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html), 
including memory usage, vector indexing performance, and query performance versus accuracy. 

This post in this series on billion scale search introduces a cost-efficient _hybrid_ method
for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search combining (`HNSW`) with disk-backed inverted file.
We name this hybrid method for ANN search for `HNSW-IF`.   

## Introduction

In-memory algorithms, like [HNSW](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html), 
for approximate nearest neighbor search, offer fast, high accuracy vector search
but quickly become expensive for massive vector datasets due to memory requirements. 
The `HNSW` algorithm requires storing the vector data in memory for low latency access during query and indexing. 

For example, a billion scale vector dataset using 768 dimensions with float precision requires 
close to 3TiB of memory. In addition, the `HNSW` graph data structure needs to be in-memory,
which adds 20-40% in addition to the vector data. 
Given this, indexing a 1B vector dataset using `HNSW` will need about 4TiB of memory.

In 2022, many cloud providers offer [cloud instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/high-memory/) 
with large amounts of memory, but these instance types also come with many v-CPUs, which 
drives production deployment costs. These high-memory and high-compute instance types support massive queries per second and 
might be the optimal instance type for applications needing to support large query throughput with high recall. 
However, many real-world applications using vector search do not need enormous query throughput but still 
need to search large billion-scale vector datasets with relatively low latency with high accuracy. 
Therefore, large cloud instance types with thousands of GiB of memory and hundreds 
of v-CPUs are not cost-efficient for those low query volume use cases. 

Due to this, there is an increasing interest in hybrid ANN search 
solutions using [solid-state disks (SSD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive) 
to store most of the vector data combined with in-memory graph data structures. 
[SPANN: Highly-efficient Billion-scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08566) 
introduces a simple and effective solution for _hybrid_ ANN search. 

## Introducing SPANN 
*SPANN* combines the graph-based in-memory method for ANN search with the inverted file using clustering.  
*SPANN* partitions the vector dataset of `M` vectors into `N` clusters. 
The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08566) explores setting `N` to a number between 4% to 20% of `M`. 
A *centroid vector* represents each cluster. 
The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08566) describes different algorithms for 
clustering the vector dataset into `N` clusters and finds that *hierarchical balanced clustering* (HBC) works best. 
See *Figure 10* in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08566): *Different types of centroid selection*.

The cluster centroid vector points to a [posting list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) 
containing the vectors close to the cluster centroid. Disk-based data structures back the posting lists of non-centroids, 
and centroids are indexed using an in-memory ANN search algorithm. Unlike
quantization techniques for ANN search, all vector distance calculations are performed 
with the full-precision vector representation. 

SPANN searches for the `k` closest centroid vectors of the query vector in the in-memory ANN search 
data structure. Then, it reads the `k` associated posting lists for the retrieved 
centroids and computes the distance between the query vector
and the vector data read from the posting list. 

<img src="/assets/2022-06-07-vespa-spann-billion-scale-vector-search/spann-posting-lists.excalidraw.png">
<em>**Figure 1** illustrates SPANN.</em>

_Figure 1_ gives a conceptual overview of *SPANN* for a small vector dataset of ten vectors. 
There are two centroid vectors, vectors 4 and 9, referencing a posting list 
consisting of the vectors close to the cluster the centroid represents. 
A vector might be close to multiple cluster centroids, for example, vector 5 and vector 8 in the figure above. 
These are examples of boundary vectors that lay in between multiple centroids. 

The offline clustering part of *SPANN* tries to balance the clusters so
that the posting lists are equal in size to reduce the time it takes to read the posting list from disk. 
For example, if the vector has 100 dimensions using `int8` precision and `int32` for the vector id,
each posting list entry uses 104 bytes. With a 4KiB disk read page size, 
one can read 1024 posting entries in a single IO read operation. 

## Hybrid HNSW-IF with Vespa 

Inspired by the *SPANN* [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08566), we at the Vespa team 
implemented a simplified version of `SPANN` using _Vespa primitives_, released
as a Vespa [sample application](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/billion-scale-vector-search). 
We call this _hybrid_ ANN search method for `HNSW-IF`.  

[Vespa features](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/features.html) used to implement `HNSW-IF`:

* Real-time [HNSW](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html) vector indexing 
* Real-time inverted index data structures
* Disk based vectors using Vespa dense tensor type using [paged](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/attributes.html#paged-attributes) option 
* [Phased ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html)
* Stateless search and document [processors](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/developer-guide.html)

The following sections outline the differences between the method described in the `SPANN` paper and the
Vespa `HNSW-IF` [sample application](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/billion-scale-vector-search) 
implementation using Vespa primitives.

### Vector Indexing and Serving architecture

* Instead of clustering and computing centroids offline, let vectors from the original dataset 
represent centroids and use the original vector id as the centroid id.
This approach does not waste any distance calculations at query time as the 
centroids are valid eligible vectors. A subset of the vector dataset (20%) is 
selected randomly to represent centroids. Random centroid selection only 
requires one pass through the vector dataset, splitting the dataset into 
*centroids* and *non-centroids*. 

* The vectors representing centroids are indexed in memory using
Vespa's support for vector indexing using
[Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html). 
Searching 200M centroid vectors indexed with `HNSW` typically takes 2-3 milliseconds, single-threaded (depending on recall
target and `HNSW` settings). Both the graph data structure and the vector data are stored in memory. 

* During indexing of vectors that are not cluster centroids,
search for the `k` closest centroids in the `HNSW` graph of centroids and index the 
closest centroid *ids* using Vespa's support for inverted indexes.
Later, when the index build is complete, a search for a centroid *id* efficiently retrieves
the closest non-centroid vector *id*. 
The inverted index consists of a dictionary of centroid ids pointing to 
posting lists of non-centroid vector ids. For a given billion scale dataset with 20% centroids, 
the maximum centroid dictionary vocabulary size is 200M. 

* A non-centroid vector might be present in multiple centroid clusters. 
Instead of storing the vector data in the posting lists, the vector data 
is stored in a separate Vespa data structure and avoids duplication 
caused by storing the same vector data in multiple posting lists.
Instead, the Vespa posting list entry stores the closeness (inverted distance) of the vector to the centroid,
scaled to integer weight. Only the vector ids are duplicated across centroid posting lists, 
not the vector data itself. Vespa posting lists are compressed using standard techniques for
lossless posting list compression. 

### Querying Vectors 

For an input query vector, first search the vectors representing centroids, using `HNSW`, for the `k` closest centroids. 
Next, using the retrieved `k` nearest centroids from `HNSW` search, 
search the inverted index using logical disjunction (OR) of the centroid ids retrieved
by the `HNSW` graph search. The actual implementation uses the
Vespa [dotProduct](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/multivalue-query-operators.html#dotproduct-example) multivalued query operator.

Each node involved in the inverted index query ranks the retrieved non-centroid vectors by
calculating the distance between the vector and the query vector. Finally, the result of the two
searches is merged and returned. 

The query serving flow can be optimized by two heuristics:

* **Cluster centroid dynamic pruning**. After retrieving the `k` closest centroids from searching the `HNSW` graph, 
distant centroids (compared to the nearest centroid) can be pruned without significantly impacting recall. 
This distant centroid pruning heuristic reduces the number of seeks and reads 
for the inverted index query evaluation.
The centroid pruning heuristic is dynamic; a query vector that retrieves 
many equally close centroids allows little pruning, while a query vector that retrieves 
centroids with more considerable distance differences might allow pruning many. 


* **Retrieve using dynamic pruning**. This heuristic sorts the retrieved vector ids by the 
`closeness(q, centroid) * closeness(centroid, v)` transitive closeness score where `q` is the query vector and `v` is the document vector. 
This phase is implemented as a Vespa [first-phase](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html#two-phase-ranking-content-nodes)
ranking phase. The `closeness(centroid,v)` weight is stored in the posting list, and the `closeness(q, centroid)`
is passed as a [query term weight](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/multivalue-query-operators.html#dotproduct-example) 
with the `dotProduct` query operator. This heuristic enables limiting the number of vector page-ins by using Vespa's support
for controlling [phased ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html). 
The local per node second-phase ranking calculates the full precision, `(closeness(q,v)`, which involves 
paging the vector data into memory from disk. The maximum re-ranking depth is
a query time hyperparameter enabling easy experimentation. 

## Real-world considerations
Real-world applications using vector search need both batch and real-time vector indexing:

* **Batch indexing**: An embedder model 
(for example, [Data2Vec](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-first-high-performance-self-supervised-algorithm-that-works-for-speech-vision-and-text/)) 
that maps data to vector representation is trained, and embedding vector representations are produced for all known data items. 
* **Incremental Real-time indexing**: A new data item arrives and is encoded with the current version of the embedder model and needs to be indexed.

In addition, data items (with vector representation) need to be updated and deleted. The hybrid method
described in this blog post supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the standard Vespa
APIs.  

* Batch indexing with a new embedder model is handled by adding a model version field to the schema. Serving queries
must restrict the search for vectors to the given model id using 
standard inverted index query evaluation and constrained vector search. 
See [Query Time Constrained Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](https://blog.vespa.ai/constrained-approximate-nearest-neighbor-search/) and
[Embedding model hot swap](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/tutorials/models-hot-swap.html). 
Having multiple active model versions increases the storage-related deployment cost linearly with the number of models. 

* New vectors using an existing embedding model are added as a non-centroid vector. 
As long as the ratio of centroids is large, one can expect to grow the vector volume significantly without 
significantly degrading accuracy. 

The only thing the application owner needs to consider is that deleting large amounts of centroid vectors
will negatively impact recall. For most large-scale vector use cases, this is not a real problem. If the use case requires
deleting many vector items, one can consider decoupling centroids from real vectors so that centroids 
are real centroids and not vectors part of the dataset. 

## Vespa Experimental Setup
The following section describes our experiments with the Vespa `HNSW-IF` sample application using 
Vespa Cloud's [performance environment](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/reference/environments#perf). 
The Vespa Cloud performance environment makes it easy to iteratively develop applications and choose the ideal instance types 
for any size vector dataset.

<img src="/assets/2022-06-07-vespa-spann-billion-scale-vector-search/Spann-serving.excalidraw.png">
<em>Vespa `HNSW-IF` serving architecture overview.</em>

The Vespa `HNSW-IF` representation uses the same 
Vespa document schema to represent centroid and non-centroid vectors.
They are differentiated using a single field of type `bool`.    

Using two content clusters with the same document schema 
enables using different instance types for the two vector types: 
 
* High memory instances with remote storage for the centroid vectors using in-memory `HNSW`.
* Inexpensive low memory instances with fast local storage for the non-centroid vectors.

This optimizes the deployment and resource cost - the vectors indexed using `HNSW` 
does not need fast local disks since queries will never page data from disk during queries. 
Similarly, for vectors indexed using inverted file, the instances don't 
need an awful amount of memory, but more memory can improve query performance 
due to page caching.  

The Vespa inverted index posting lists do not contain the vector data. 
Instead, vector data is stored using Vespa [paged tensor attributes](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/attributes.html#paged-attributes),
a type of disk-backed memory mapped forward-index. The downside of not storing the vector 
data in the postings file is that paging in a vector from disk for distance calculation requires one 
additional disk seek. However, in our experience, locally attached SSD disks are rarely limited by random seek 
but by GiB/s throughput bandwidth. 

### Vector Dataset
For our experiments with `HNSW-IF`, we use the 1B *Microsoft SPACEV-1B* vector dataset:

>Microsoft SPACEV-1B is a new web search-related dataset
 released by Microsoft Bing for this competition. 
 It consists of document and query vectors encoded by the 
 Microsoft SpaceV Superior model to capture generic intent representation.

The *SPACEV-1B* vector dataset consists of 1-Billion 100-dimensional vectors using `int8` precision
and 29,3K queries with 100 ground truth (exact neighbors) per query. 
The [distance-metric](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/schema-reference.html#distance-metric) used for the dataset
is `euclidean` which is the default Vespa nearest neighbor search distance-metric. 
The dataset's ground truth neighbors are used to evaluate the 
accuracy (recall) of the hybrid `HNSW-IF` approach. 

### Vespa Schema 
The sample application uses the following Vespa [document schema](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/schemas.html).
Supported Vespa schema [field types](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/schema-reference.html#field)
include `string`, `long`, `int`, `float`, `double`, geo `position`, `bool`, `byte`, and `tensor` fields. 
Vespa’s first-order dense [tensor](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/tensor-user-guide.html) fields represent vector fields. 
Vespa's tensor fields support different [tensor cell precision](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/performance/feature-tuning.html#cell-value-types) types,
including `int8`, `bfloat16`, `float`, and `double` for real-valued vectors. The `SPACEV-1B` vector dataset uses `int8` precision. 

<pre>
schema vector {

  document vector {

    field id type int {}

    field vector type tensor&lt;int8&gt;(x[100]) {
      indexing: attribute | index
    }

    field neighbors type weightedset&lt;string&gt; {
      indexing: summary | index
    }

    field disk_vector type tensor&lt;int8&gt;(x[100]) {
      indexing: attribute
      attribute: paged
    }

    field in_graph type bool {}
  }
}
</pre>
<em>Vespa `vector` document schema. See [full version](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/billion-scale-vector-search/src/main/application/schemas/vector.sd)</em>

The random centroid selection is performed outside of Vespa using a
[python script](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/billion-scale-vector-search/src/main/python/create-vespa-feed.py) that reads the 
input vector data file and randomly selects 20% to represent centroids and sets the `in_graph` field
of type `bool` to `true` and populate the `vector` field with the vector data. 
The feeder feeds the vector data with `in_graph` set to `true` first, to 
populate the `graph` content cluster using `HNSW` indexing, before feeding the non-centroid vectors. 

The `neighbors` field is of type 
[weightedset&lt;string&gt;](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/schema-reference.html#weightedset).
 The `weightedset<string>`type allows mapping a string key (the centroid id in this case) to an integer weight. 
This field is populated by a 
[custom document processor](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/billion-scale-vector-search/src/main/java/ai/vespa/examples/docproc/AssignNeighborsDocProc.java) 
which searches the `HNSW` graph when feeding non-centroid vectors with `in_graph` set to `false`. 

For example, for vector 8 from *figure 1*, the field would be populated with 
two centroids found from searching the `HNSW` graph:

<pre>
{
    "put": "id:spann:vector::8"
    "fields": {
        "id": "8",
        "neighbors": {
            "4": 45
            "9": 100
        },
        "in_graph": false,
        "disk_vector": {
            "values": [12, -8, 1, ..]
        }
    }
}
</pre>

This `neighbors` field is inverted by the Vespa content process (proton), so that a query for 
`where neighbors contains "4"` would retrieve vector 8 and expose it to the Vespa ranking framework. 

The integer weight represents the closeness of vector 8 to the centroid id. 
Closeness is the inverted distance, and a lower distance means higher closeness. 
The original `float` closeness value returned from the `HNSW` search is scaled to integer representation by
multiplying with a constant and rounded to the closest integer. 

The document processor clears the incoming `vector` field and instead creates 
the `disk_vector` field, which uses the `attribute: paged` option for paging in
the vector data on-demand at ranking time.  

The schema also has two `rank-profile`'s which determines how vectors are ranked while performing
distance calculations. One profile used for the `HNSW` search and one for the `Inverted File` search
implementing phased ranking heuristic.

### Vespa deployment specification 
We use multiple stateless and stateful Vespa clusters in the same Vespa application for our experiments.
Everything related to clusters and resources is configured using [Vespa services.xml](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/reference/services). The 
sample application has two `services.xml`:

* [Self-hosted Vespa services.xml](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/billion-scale-vector-search/src/main/application/services.xml)
* [Vespa Cloud services.xml](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/billion-scale-vector-search/src/main/application/cloud-services.xml)

The Vespa Cloud version specifies:

* A stateless `feed` container cluster handling feed operations running a custom document processor
which searches the HNSW graph for non-centroid vectors. 
This cluster uses default resources which are 2 v-CPU, 8GiB of memory, and 50GiB of disk:
<pre>
    &lt;nodes deploy:environment="perf" count="4"/&gt;
</pre>

* A stateless `default` container cluster handling search queries. This cluster also uses default resources.
<pre>
    &lt;nodes deploy:environment="perf" count="2"/&gt;
</pre>

* A stateful content cluster `graph` which is used with high memory instance types and `HNSW`. 
<pre>
 &lt;nodes deploy:environment="perf" count="1" groups="1"&gt;
    &lt;resources memory="128GB" vcpu="16" 
      disk="200Gb" storage-type="remote"/&gt;
&lt;/nodes&gt;
 </pre>
* A stateful content cluster `if` used for inverted indexing (inverted file) for non-centroid vectors. 
<pre>
&lt;nodes deploy:environment="perf" count="4" groups="1"&gt;
    &lt;resources memory="32GB" vcpu="8" 
      disk="300Gb" storage-type="local"/&gt;
 &lt;/nodes&gt;
</pre>

The Vespa Cloud hourly cost for this `perf` environment deployment, supporting 1B vectors comfortably, is $ 8.38 per hour, or
$6,038 per month. 

<img src="/assets/2022-06-07-vespa-spann-billion-scale-vector-search/clusters.png"/>
<em>Screenshot from Vespa Cloud console with app's clusters and allocated resources.</em>

As can be seen from the cluster resource scaling summary, the deployment is slightly 
over-provisioned and could support larger vector volumes
comfortably. Vespa Cloud also allows a wide range of resource combinations (memory, CPU, disk) and 
the number of nodes per Vespa cluster. 

### Vespa stateless function components 
Custom stateless Vespa functions implement the serving and processing logic. The
components are deployed inside the Vespa cluster, where communication is secured, and data transferred
with optimized binary protocols. The gist of the custom 
[searcher](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/searcher-development.html) implementing
the search logic is given below:

<pre>
@Override
public Result search(Query query, Execution execution) {
    Tensor queryVector = query.getTensor("query(q)");
    CentroidResult centroidResult = clustering.getCentroids(
        queryVector,
        nClusters,
        hnswExploreHits,
        execution);
    List&lt;Centroid&gt; centroids = clustering.prune(
        centroidResult.getCentroids(),
        pruneThreshold);

    DotProductItem dp = new DotProductItem("neighbors");
    for (Centroid c : centroids) {
        dp.addToken(c.getId(), c.getIntCloseness());
    }
    query.getModel().getQueryTree().setRoot(dp);
    query.getModel().setSources("if");
    query.getRanking().setRerankCount(reRankCount);
    return mergeResult(execution.search(query), centroidResult);
}
</pre>
See the [full version](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/billion-scale-vector-search/src/main/java/ai/vespa/examples/searcher/SPANNSearcher.java).

Similarly, a custom [document processor](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/document-processing.html) implements
the search in the `HNSW` graph, and annotates the incoming vector with the nearest centroids. 
See [AssignNeighborsDocProc](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/billion-scale-vector-search/src/main/java/ai/vespa/examples/docproc/AssignNeighborsDocProc.java).


## Vespa HNSW-IF Experiments 
The following experiments use these fixed indexing side hyperparameters:

- In-memory centroid indexing using the following [HNSW](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html) settings: 
`max-links-per-node: 18` and `neighbors-to-explore-at-insert: 100`.
- For any given non-centroid vector, the 12 closest centroid vector ids are indexed using the inverted index. 

### Batch indexing performance 

With the mentioned allocated resources in Vespa Cloud *perf*, indexing the *SPACEV-1B* dataset takes approximately 28 hours. 
The 200M centroid vectors are fed first and indexed at around 9000 puts/s into the HNSW graph content cluster. 
The remaining 800M non-centroid vectors are indexed with similar puts/s, and also search the `HNSW` index at the same rate.

Vectors are read from the dataset and converted to [Vespa JSON feed format](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/document-json-format.html)
by a python script. The resulting two JSON files are fed using [Vespa feed client](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/vespa-feed-client.html)
for ultimate batch feed performance using `http/2` with `mTls` to secure the vector data in transit. Vespa Cloud
also stores all data using encryption (encryption at rest).

<em>Vespa Cloud metrics dashboard.</em>

The [Vespa Cloud metrics](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/monitoring) provide insight into resource utilization which can
help choose the right instance resource specification. 

### HNSW-IF accuracy 
Any approximate vector search use case needs to quantify the accuracy impact of using approximate search instead of
exact search. Using the ground truth neighbors for the 29,3K *SPACEV-1B* query vectors, 
we can quantify `recall@10` with the hybrid `HNSW-IF` solution:

<img src="/assets/2022-06-07-vespa-spann-billion-scale-vector-search/recall.png"/>
<em>Recall@10 for 29,3K queries</em>

The above figure is produced by running all 29,3K queries with an increasing number of `k` centroids, ranging
from 1 centroid to 256 centroids (1, 2, 4, 8 , 16, 32, 64, 128, 256). The distance prune threshold was set to 0.6, 
and the maximum re-ranking depth was 4K. 
Example run using [recall.py](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/billion-scale-vector-search/src/main/python/recall.py)
with 32 centroid clusters `k=32`, re-ranking at most 4K vectors.  

<pre>
$ python3 recall.py --endpoint https://spann.samples.aws-us-east-1c.perf.z.vespa-app.cloud/search/ \
  --query_file query.i8bin \
  --query_gt_file public_query_gt100.bin \
  --clusters 32 \
  --distance_prune_threshold 0.6 \
  --rank_count 4000 \
  --certificate data-plane-public-cert.pem \
  --key data-plane-private-key.pem
</pre>

With `k=128` centroids, we reach 90% recall@10 at just below 50 ms end-to-end. 
50 ms is one order of magnitude larger than what in-memory algorithms support at the same recall level, 
but for many vector search use cases, 50ms is perfectly acceptable, especially considering the high recall. 
To put the number in context, 9 out of 10 queries return the *same* top-10 result as the expensive nearest neighbor search, over 1B vectors! 

## Summary 

This blog post introduced a cost-effective _hybrid_ method for billion-scale vector search, enabling 
many new real-world applications using AI-powered vector representations. Today, You can get started using the

The application has multi-vector representations for re-ranking, using Vespa's [phased retrieval and ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html) 
pipelines. Furthermore, the application shows how embedding models, which map the text data to vector representation, can be 
deployed to Vespa for [run-time inference](https://blog.vespa.ai/stateless-model-evaluation/) during document and query processing.

- [State-of-the-art image search](https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/text-image-search): AI-powered multi-modal vector representations
to retrieve images for a text query. 

These are examples of applications built using AI-powered vector representations and where real-world deployments 
need query-time constrained nearest neighbor search. 

Vespa is available as a cloud service; see [Vespa Cloud - getting started](https://cloud.vespa.ai/en/getting-started),
or self-serve [Vespa - getting started](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/getting-started.html).
