This blog post explores using large language models (LLMs) to
generate labeled data for training ranking models. Distilling the
knowledge and power of generative models with billions of parameters
to ranking models with a few million parameters. The approach uses
a handful of human-annotated labeled examples (few-shot) and prompts
the LLM to generate synthetic queries for documents in the corpus.

The ability to create high-quality synthetic training data might
be a turning point with the potential to revolutionize information
retrieval. With a handful of human annotations, the LLMs can generate
infinite amounts of high-quality labeled data at a low cost. Training data which
is used to train much smaller and compute efficient ranking models.

## Introduction

Language models built on the
[Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) architecture have
[revolutionized text ranking
overnight](https://blog.vespa.ai/pretrained-transformer-language-models-for-search-part-1/),
advancing the state-of-the-art by more than 30% on the MS MARCO
relevance dataset. However, Transformer-based ranking models need
significant amounts of labeled data and supervision to realize their
potential. Obtaining high-quality annotated data for training deep
ranking models is labor-intensive and costly. Therefore, many
organizations try to overcome the labeling cost problem by using
pseudo-labels derived from click models. Click models use query-document
user interaction from previously seen queries to label documents.
Unfortunately, ranking models trained on click-data suffer from
multiple bias issues, such as presentation bias and survivorship
bias towards the existing ranking model.

In addition, what if you want to build a great search experience
in a new domain without any interaction data (cold-start) or resources
to obtain sufficient amounts of labeled data to train neural ranking
models? The answer might be generative large language models (LLMs),
which can generate training data to train a ranking model adapted
to the domain and use case.


## Generative large language models (LLMs)

The public interest in generative language models (LLMs) has
skyrocketed since [OpenAI released ChatGPT in November
2022](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/). The
[GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3) model is trained on a
massive amount of text data using unsupervised learning and can
generate human-like text given a text prompt input.

Google is another leader in the language model space, except they
have not exposed any of them in a public chat-like interface like
OpenAI. In [Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language
Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416), researchers from Google
describe a few of their generative language models and instruction
fine-tuning. In contrast to OpenAI and many other language model
providers, Google has open-sourced their generative FLAN-T5 models
in [various model
sizes](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/docs/models.md#flan-t5-checkpoints),
up to 11B parameters, using a permissive Apache 2.0 License.

Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416)_

A critical difference between **large** generative language models
and a vanilla BERT ranking model is that they necessarily donâ€™t
require task-specific fine-tuning of the model weights. Massive
self-supervised training on piles of text, coupled with later
fine-tuning on a broad, diverse set of tasks, is one of the reasons
they are called [foundation models
(FM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models).

The foundation model weights are frozen, but we can adapt the model
to our task by mixing natural language instructions with data in
the prompt input. The art of mixing instructions and data in an LLM
instruction prompt has created a new artistic engineering field;
[prompt engineering.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)
We can improve the model's generated output using prompt engineering
by changing the instructions written in natural language.


## Generating labeled data via instruction-prompting Large Language Models

Instruction-prompting large language models (LLMs) have also entered
the information retrieval research (IR). A recent trend in IR
research is to use generative LLMs, such as GPT-3, to generate
synthetic data to train ranking models [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5].

The general idea is to design an instruction prompt with a few
labeled relevance examples fed to the LLM (large language model)
to generate synthetic queries or documents. The instruction prompts
that generate artificial questions are the most promising direction
since all you need is a few labeled queries, document examples, and
samples from the document corpus. In addition, with synthetic query
generators, you avoid running inference with computationally expensive
LLM at user time, which can be[ unrealistic for most
organizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05102). Instead, the
synthetic generation process is performed offline with LLM-powered
query generators. Offline inference with LLMs is considerably less
engineering-intensive than online usage, as inference latency is
not a concern.

LLMs will hallucinate and sometimes produce fake queries that are
too generic or irrelevant. To overcome this, researchers [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] 
use a ranking model (RM) to test the query quality. One can, for example, rank
documents from the corpus for each generated synthetic query using
the RM. The synthetic query is only retained for model training if
the source document ranks highly. This query consistency check
grounds the LLM output and improves the training data. Once the
synthetic queries and positive (relevant) document pairs are filtered,
one can sample negative (potentially irrelevant) examples and train
a ranking model adapted to the domain, the characteristics of the
document corpus, and the few-show query examples.

## Experiments

In the previous posts on [zero-shot ranking
experiments](https://blog.vespa.ai/improving-zero-shot-ranking-with-vespa-part-two/),
we evaluated zero-shot ranking models on 13 [BEIR
benchmark](https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir) datasets. We reported
large gains in ranking effectiveness by a hybrid ranking model that
combines unsupervised BM25 ranking with a neural ranking model
trained on a large relevance dataset. This hybrid model is an example
of a zero-shot ranking model without any fine-tuning or adaption
to the new domain.

In this work, we want to see if we can improve the effectiveness
by using a large language model to create synthetic training data
for the new domain. We focus on one of the BEIR datasets, the
bio-medical [trec-covid](https://ir.nist.gov/trec-covid/) IR dataset.
We chose this dataset because we have previously built a simple
demo [search UI](https://cord19.vespa.ai/) and [Vespa
app](https://github.com/vespa-cloud/cord-19-search), indexing the
final CORD-19 dataset. With this demo, we can deploy the ranking
models to a production app in Vespa cloud. The following subsections
describe the experimental setup. We also publish three
[notebooks](https://github.com/vespa-cloud/cord-19-search/tree/main/notebooks)
demonstrating the 3-stage process.


### Synthetic query generation

We chose the open-source 3 Billion
[flan-t5-xl](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xl) generative
model as our artificial query generator. The model is genuine
open-source, licensed with a permissive Apache 2.0 license. We
devise the following few-shot instruction prompt template.

```
These are examples of queries with sample relevant documents for
each query. The query must be specific and detailed.

Example 1:
document: $document_example_1
query: $query_example_1

Example 2:
document: #document_example_2
query: $query_example_2

Example 3:
document: $document_example_3
query: $query_example

Example 4:
document: $input_document
query:
```

Our first prompt did not include the _The query must be specific
and detailed_ phrase. Without it, many eye-balled queries were too
generic. Changing the prompt made the model produce more specific
queries.

We use three trec-covid test queries as our in-domain examples for
few-shot instruction examples. We pick the first document annotated
as highly relevant to form the complete query-document example.
Finally, we iterate over the document collection, replace the
$input_document variable with a concatenation of the title and
abstract, then run an inference with the model and store the generated
query. We use an A100 40GB GPU, which costs about 1$/hour and can
generate about 3600 synthetic queries per hour.

At completion, we ended up with synthetic queries for 33,099 documents
out of 171K docs. Notice that the three query-document examples are
the same for all document-to-query creations and that the modelâ€™s
max input sequence length limits the number of examples we can fit
into the prompt.


### Query consistency checking

We use a robust [zero-shot hybrid ranking
mode](https://blog.vespa.ai/improving-zero-shot-ranking-with-vespa-part-two/)l
for query consistency checking. The generated query is retained for
training only if the source document is ranked #1 by the zero-shot
model. If the question passes this test, we also sample two negative
query-document pairs from the top 100 documents ranked by the
zero-shot model. After the consistency filter, the number of positive
query, document pairs drops to 14,156.

_Dataframe with the generated synthetic queries and the document
metadata. The document abstract is summarized by the query contextual
[Vespa dynamic
summary](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/document-summaries.html#dynamic-summaries)
feature. There are three rows in the data frame for each unique
generated question, one positive (relevant) document and two
irrelevant. This is the input to the next step, which is to train
a ranking model on this purely synthetic data._


### Rank model training

After query generation and consistency checking, we use the synthetic
query and document pairs to train a ranking model. As [in previous
work,](https://blog.vespa.ai/improving-product-search-with-ltr-part-two/)
we use a cross-encoder based on a 6-layer MiniLM model with just
22M trainable parameters. We train the model for two epochs on the
synthetic data and export the model to [ONNX for inference in
Vespa](https://blog.vespa.ai/stateful-model-serving-how-we-accelerate-inference-using-onnx-runtime/).
And finally, we deploy the fine-tuned model as a re-ranking phase
on top of the top-k results from the hybrid model, and we limit the
re-ranking k to 30 documents.


## Evaluation & Results

We contrast the model tuned by synthetic queries with ranking models
evaluated in the [zero-shot ranking blog
post](https://blog.vespa.ai/improving-zero-shot-ranking-with-vespa-part-two/)
on the trec-covid dataset.

![alt_text](/assets/2023-02-03-improving-text-ranking-with-few-shot-prompting/results.png)

We gain four nDCG@10 points over the strong hybrid zero-shot model
and 10 nDCG@10 points over unsupervised BM25. These are significant
gains, especially given the low training and inference costs. We
also note that the Vespa BM25 baseline is strong, beating other
BM25 implementations on the same dataset. The model trained on
synthetic data outperforms the
[PROMPTAGTOR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11755) model, which uses
a proprietary 137B FLAN checkpoint to generate synthetic queries.
In the paper they report a nDCG@10 of 76.2 on trec-covid. Finally,
we contrast with [OpenAIâ€™s GPT embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10005)
paper, where OpenAI reporst a nDCG@10 score of 64.9 for their GPT
XL embeddings on trec-covid.

## Deploying to production

There are two reasons for choosing a cross-encoder model over a
bi-encoder for our synthetic fueled ranking model.

* Cross-encoders are generally more effective than bi-encoders 2.
* Updating the cross-encoder model weight does not require re-processing
the document corpus. With bi-encoders using single vector
representations, developers would have to re-process the document-side
embeddings every time a new prompt-trained ranking model is available.
With a cross-encoder, model versioning and A/B testing are easier
to operationalize.

Cross-encoderâ€™s downside is the computational complexity at query
time, which is quadratic with model sequence input length. We deploy
a trick to reduce the model input sequence; we input the query,
title, and a query contextual [Vespa dynamic
summary](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/document-summaries.html#dynamic-summaries)
of the abstract. The dynamic abstract summarization reduces the
sequence length while retaining segments of the abstract that matches
the query. Furthermore, we limit the complexity by reducing the
re-ranking depth to 30. Finally, we deploy the trained model to our
[https://cord19.vespa.ai/](https://cord19.vespa.ai/) demo site,
where users can choose between the prompt-generated model or the
previously described [zero-shot ranking
models](https://blog.vespa.ai/improving-zero-shot-ranking-with-vespa-part-two/).


## Conclusion

Synthetic query generation via instruction-prompted LLMs is a
promising approach for overcoming the label shortage problem. With
just three human labeled examples, the query generator, built on
an open-source flan-t5 model, could generate high-quality training
data.

 As part of this work, we open-source three notebooks:

* [Flan-t5 query generator with instruction prompt
](https://github.com/vespa-cloud/cord-19-search/blob/main/notebooks/generate_synthetic_data_using_t5.ipynb)
* [Consistency query checking and negative
sampling](https://github.com/vespa-cloud/cord-19-search/blob/main/notebooks/generate_synthetic_training_data_with_consistency_check.ipynb)
* [Training the cross-encoder ranking model using the consistency-checked
data](https://github.com/vespa-cloud/cord-19-search/blob/main/notebooks/train_ranking_model.ipynb)

In addition to these resources; we open-source the generated
[synthetic
queries](https://github.com/vespa-cloud/cord-19-search/blob/main/trec-covid-queries.tsv)
and the consistency-checked training data
([trec_covid_train_data_k1.parquet](https://data.vespa.oath.cloud/sample-apps-data/trec_covid_train_data_k1.parquet)).
The training data includes the zero-shot scores, the title, and the
query contextual summarization of the abstract. The end-to-end Vespa
application is also
[open-sourced](https://github.com/vespa-cloud/cord-19-search).

In future work, weâ€™ll look at how generative models can be used for
re-ranking, summarization, and generative question answering.
Improving retrieval effectiveness is step one in improving the
overall effectiveness of any retrieval-augmented system.
