excerpt: Vespa is becoming its own company!
---

A month ago we announced that Vespa is finally
[its own company](https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-is-becoming-its-own-company/). 
Today we're announcing a $31 million 
[investment from Blossom Capital](https://www.blossomcap.com/portfolio/vespa-ai).

all use cases involving big data and AI online, and serving large and small customers on our
[cloud solution](https://cloud.vespa.ai).

and efficient decision-making (we're kind of into speed).
