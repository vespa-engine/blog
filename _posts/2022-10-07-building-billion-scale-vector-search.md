How fast is fast? Many consider the blink of an eye, around 100-250ms, to be plenty fast. Try blinking 10 times in a
second? If you can manage, your blink of an eye latency is around 100ms. But did you know that algorithms and data
structures for approximate vector search can search across billions of vectors in high dimensional space in a few
milliseconds? 

In this blog post, we look at how fast is fast enough in the context of vector search, and how the answer to this
question impacts how we design and build a billion-scale vector search solution. 


## Introduction

Advances in self-supervised deep learning have revolutionized information extraction from unstructured data like[
text](https://blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/),[
audio](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/),[ image](https://openai.com/blog/clip/), and[
videos](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/generative-ai-text-to-video/). In addition to these modalities, multimodality
models are on the rise, combining multiple modalities, for example, text and image data. These advances in deep learning
leading to better vector representations of data have driven increased interest in searching these representations at
scale. 

![vectorization](/assets/2022-10-07-building-billion-scale-vector-search/ml-models.png)


Any machine learning algorithm must transform the input and output data into a data format the machine understands. This
is where vectors and, generally, tensors come into the picture.

> **Everything can be represented as a vector in high-dimensional vector space**

Using mentioned ML models, we can convert our data into vectors and index the vectors using an algorithm for[ nearest
neighbor search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search). Given a query, for example, a picture, a text
document, a search query, or [dating
preferences](https://tech.okcupid.com/vespa-vs-elasticsearch-for-matching-millions-of-people-6e3af18eb4dc), we can
convert it into a vector representation using the same model we used to index our collection. Then, we can use this
representation to search for similar data in the collection using vector search in the high dimensional vector space. 

Searching over a few million vector representations is trivial as the index can fit into a single instance. There is
much tooling for searching small amounts of vector data, where all the data can serve in a single node. We can replicate
the index over more nodes if we need to scale query throughput. However, we need to distribute the data over multiple
nodes with more data. 


## More data, more problems

Building out real-time serving infrastructure for searching over billion-scale or trillion-scale vector datasets is one
of the most[ challenging problems in computing](https://blog.vespa.ai/the-hardest-problem-in-computing/) and has been
reserved for FAANG-sized organizations. When the data no longers fit into a single instance, data must be distributed
over multiple serving instances. With more instances come failure modes. The serving system needs to implement
resilience for failures, distributed search over an elastic number of partitions, and replication to avoid losing data
in case of failures. 

More data and more problems are reflected by the high pricing of cloud-based vector search solutions. In addition, the
pricing tells a story of the infrastructure complexity and market demand for fully managed cloud-based vector search
solutions.

For example, suppose your organization wants to index 1B 512-dimensional vectors using[ Google Vertex AI Matching
Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing). In that case, you'll be adding $389,000 per month to
your GCP cloud bill. That quote example is for one batch job of vectors. Each new batch indexing job adds $6,000. The
quote does not cover storing the data that produced the vectors; that data must be served out of a different serving
store.


## Building cost-efficient large-scale vector search 

Over the past few years, we have made a few observations around scaling vector search to billions of data items:

* Surprisingly, many organizations have a lot of raw unstructured data,
  petabytes of data that easily reach billions of rows.
* AI models to generate vector representations from this data have become a commodity,
  thanks to [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/). 
* Few organizations have Google’s level of query traffic searching the data.
* Few organizations need query serving latency much lower than the blink of an eye [^1].
* Query volume changes and pre-provisioning resources for peak query traffic wastes resources. 

These observations impact our design for a cost-efficient billion-scale vector search solution. 

The quickest and most accurate methods for approximate nearest neighbors search (ANNS) use in-memory data structures.
For example, the popular HNSW graph algorithm for ANNS requires storing the vectors in memory for low latency access
during query and indexing. In 2022, many cloud providers will offer cloud instance types with large amounts of memory,
but these types also come with many v-CPUs, which drives costs. These high-memory and high-compute instance types
support massive queries per second. They might be the optimal instance type for applications needing to support large
query throughput with high accuracy. However, as we have observed, many real-world applications do not need enormous
query throughput but still need to search sizeable billion-scale vector datasets with relatively low latency with high
accuracy. 

Due to these tradeoffs, there is an increasing interest in [hybrid
ANNS](https://blog.vespa.ai/vespa-hybrid-billion-scale-vector-search/) algorithms using solid-state disks (SSD) to store
most of the vector data combined with in-memory graph data structures. Storing the data on disk lowers costs
significantly due to storage hierarchy economics. Furthermore, 2022 cloud instances come with higher network bandwidth
than we have used to. The higher bandwidth allows us to move more data from content nodes to stateless compute nodes. In
addition, independent scaling of content and compute enables on-demand, elastic auto-scaling of resources.


## Vespa’s value proposition

Vespa, the open-source big data serving engine, makes it straightforward for an any-sized organization to implement
large-scale search and recommendation use cases. The following Vespa primitives are the foundational building blocks for
building a vector search serving system. 


### Document Schema(s)

Vespa's schema model supports structured and unstructured data types, including tensors and vectors. Representing
tensors, vectors, and unstructured data types in the same document schema avoids consistency and synchronization issues
between data stores. 

![Vespa schema example](/assets/2022-10-07-building-billion-scale-vector-search/schema.png)

A simplified Vespa document schema, expressed using Vespa’s schema language. 

### CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations

Add new documents, and update and delete documents using real-time APIs. 

### Searching structured and unstructured data in the same query request

A feature-rich[ query language](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/query-language.html) for performing efficient selections over
the data. Vespa's SQL-like query language enables efficient online selection over billions of documents, combining
search over structured and unstructured data in the same query.


### Efficient Vector Search

Vespa implements a[ real-time version of the HNSW algorithm](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/approximate-nn-hnsw.html) for
efficient and high-recall ANNS. The implementation is verified with multiple vector datasets on[
ann-benchmarks.com](http://ann-benchmarks.com/) and used in production by
[Spotify](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/03/introducing-natural-language-search-for-podcast-episodes/). 


### Highly Extensible Architecture
![architecture](https://docs.vespa.ai/assets/img/vespa-overview.svg)

Vespa allows developers to embed custom components for stateless processing, allowing separation of processing from
storage content clusters. In addition, support for multiple content clusters allows scaling stateful resources
independently. 

## Summary 

In the next blog post in this series, we'll cover the design and implementation of a cost-efficient billion-scale image
search application over multimodal AI-powered CLIP representations. The application uses a hybrid ANN solution where
most of the vector data is stored on disk and where the most computationally expensive vector similarity operations are
performed in the stateless layer to allow faster, elastic auto-scaling of resources.
