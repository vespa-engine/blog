In the [December product update]({% post_url /tumblr/2019-12-19-vespa-product-updates-december-2019 %}),
we mentioned improved ONNX support,
new rank feature attributeMatch().maxWeight,
free lists for attribute multivalue mapping,
faster updates for out-of-sync documents,
and ZooKeeper 3.5.6.

This month, we’re excited to share the following updates:


#### Tensor Functions
The tensor language has been extended with functions to allow the representation of very complex neural nets, such as [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) models, and better support for working with mapped (sparse) tensors:
* [Slice](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/ranking-expressions.html#slice)
  makes it possible to extract values and subspaces from tensors.
* [Literal tensors](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/ranking-expressions.html#literal)
  make it possible to create tensors on the fly, for instance from values sliced out of other tensors
  or from a list of scalar attributes or functions.
* [Merge](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/ranking-expressions.html#merge)
  produces a new tensor from two mapped tensors of the same type,
  where a lambda to resolve is invoked only for overlapping values.
  This can be used, for example, to supply default values which are overridden by an argument tensor.


#### New Sizing Guides
Vespa is used for applications with high performance or cost requirements.
New sizing guides for [queries](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/performance/sizing-search.html) and
[writes](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/performance/sizing-feeding.html)
are now available to help teams use Vespa optimally.


#### Performance Improvement for Matched Elements in Map/Array-of-Struct
As maps or arrays in documents can often grow large,
applications use [matched-elements-only](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/schema-reference.html#matched-elements-only)
to return only matched items. This also simplifies application code.
Performance for this feature is now improved - ex: an array or map with 20.000 elements is now 5x faster.


#### Boolean Field Query Optimization
Applications with strict latency requirements, using boolean fields and concurrent feed and query load, have a latency reduction since Vespa 7.165.5 due to an added bitCount cache. For example, we realized latency improvement from 3ms to 2ms for an application with a 30k write rate. Details in [#11879](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/pull/11879).

### Bug fixes / errata

#### Regression introduced in Vespa 7.141 may cause data loss or inconsistencies when using 'create: true' updates
There exists a regression introduced in Vespa 7.141 where updates marked as `create: true` (i.e. create if missing) may cause data loss or undetected inconsistencies in certain edge cases. This regression was introduced as part of an optimization effort to greatly reduce the common-case overhead of updates when replicas are out of sync.

Fixed in Vespa 7.157.9 and beyond. If you are running a version affected (7.141 up to and including 7.147) you are strongly advised to upgrade.

See [#11686](https://github.com/vespa-engine/vespa/issues/11686) for details.
